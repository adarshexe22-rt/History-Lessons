            <h3>Early Middle Ages (5th-10th centuries)</h3>
            <p>The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval Period, sometimes referred to as the Dark Ages, is typically regarded as lasting from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century CE. They marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history.</p>
            <p>The Early Middle Ages followed the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages (c. 1001–1300). The Early Middle Ages largely overlap with Late Antiquity. This time period is sometimes called the Dark Ages by historians, particularly in reference to Western Europe, parts of the Middle East and North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>

            <p>The term "Dark Ages" is derived from the Latin saeculum obscurum, originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 when he referred to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The concept of a "Dark Age" originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch, who regarded the post-Roman centuries as "dark" compared to the "light" of classical antiquity.</p>

            <h3>High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries)</h3>
            <p>The High Middle Ages, or High Medieval Period, was the period of European history that lasted from around 1000 to 1250 CE. The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 CE.</p>
            <p>Key historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the Renaissance of the 12th century, including the first developments of rural exodus and urbanization.</p>

            <p>By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the European economy, reaching levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. This trend was checked in the Late Middle Ages by a series of calamities, notably the Black Death but also including numerous wars and economic stagnation.</p>

            <h3>Late Middle Ages (14th-15th centuries)</h3>
            <p>The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history lasting from 1250 to 1500 CE. The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern period (and in much of Europe, the Renaissance).</p>
            <p>Around 1300, centuries of prosperity and growth in Europe came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population by as much as half according to some estimates. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare.</p>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/800x600/?medieval" alt="Late Middle Ages" class="lesson-image">
            <p>The Late Middle Ages also witnessed the rise of strong, royalty-based nation-states throughout Europe, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts of this period, such as the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of the Roses, were fought primarily with professional armies of mercenaries.</p>
